This app covers the process used to extract data from an Excel 
sheet and allow the data to be used by the world! 
The specific use case for this app is extracting data from an
Excel spread sheet. The data is the interest rates offered by various
financial institutions (the rates are fictional). Our app will accomplish
the following:

1. extract data from an Excel file using python with openpyxl
2. Insert extracted data to MySQL.
3. Create API of data using Flask/Jsonify.
4. Use Reactjs to interact with the data
